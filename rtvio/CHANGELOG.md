## Unreleased

### Drone camera lens calibration: frames undistorted before VGGT
The drone's camera has a fisheye lens: straight walls and ceiling edges
visibly bow in its frames. VGGT models a pinhole camera, so it settled on a
compromise field of view, and the reconstruction's right angles opened up.
On the first real 184 s indoor take it estimated fx 272 px at 518 px wide,
about 87° across, and a wall corner came out near 150°. The drone reports no
camera parameters. That take's telemetry carried none, and the camera sits
on the companion computer, not the flight controller.

- `camera_model.py` handles lens profiles (fisheye Kannala-Brandt or pinhole
  Brown-Conrady):
  - the real edge-to-edge field of view
  - checkerboard calibration: both models are fitted and the lower
    reprojection error wins
  - remap tables to an ideal pinhole camera
- Studio, Drone tab → **Camera calibration**:
  - Checkerboard views are captured from the live video. A view is kept
    only when the board is somewhere new. A 3×3 grid shows coverage; at
    least 10 views are needed, and capture stops at 25.
  - **Calibrate** saves the result to `data/drone_camera.json`. The views
    are kept under `data/drone_calib/<time>/`.
  - "Show undistorted" previews what VGGT will see.
- Every drone take now writes `camera_intrinsics.json`: the calibration,
  scaled to the recorded size.
- `vggt_reconstruct` remaps every frame to a pinhole before VGGT when the
  take's calibration has distortion. A take recorded before calibration is
  handed the current calibration by the Studio (`--intrinsics`).
- New flags: `--intrinsics`, `--no-undistort`, `--undistort-balance`.
- Phone takes are unaffected, since their Camera2 intrinsics carry no size
  or distortion.
- `CHECKPOINT_REPORT.md` has a new **Camera** section. It puts VGGT's own
  focal estimate next to the calibrated one, so a field-of-view mismatch
  shows up in every report.
- The drone is also asked over MAVLink for `CAMERA_INFORMATION` /
  `VIDEO_STREAM_INFORMATION`. Anything it answers is shown and stored with
  the take.
- `tools/calibrate_camera.py --model fisheye|auto` calibrates offline from
  saved views.
- `tests/test_camera_model.py` renders checkerboards through a known ~135°
  fisheye lens:
  - calibration recovers fx within 0.1% and the field of view within 0.1°
  - a straight edge the lens bows by 30 px comes out straight to 0.005 px
  - it also covers the Studio's capture → calibrate → take path
- Fixed along the way: `mavlink.encode` could not pack a message with an
  unset string field, or with a field named `name`.
- Not yet run against the real drone's camera, which needs a printed
  checkerboard held in front of it.

### Drone in RTVIO Studio: live video, telemetry, record -> reconstruct, Indoor/Outdoor
The `idronam` branch's `capture-bridge` was a standalone Node tool that
reached the drone the way the iDronam GCS does, worked out from iDronam's
own bundled code: MAVLink v2 over TCP to `<ip>:14550`, and RTSP video from
`rtsp://<ip>:10000/drone_cam`. It is now part of the Studio, ported to
Python instead of running as a second server. `studio/drone_link.py`
handles the connection and recording. `studio/mavlink.py` is a small codec
whose message layouts and CRC bytes come from the bridge's generated
`mavlink20.js`. So the Studio needs no Node runtime, no `ffmpeg.exe`
(OpenCV's bundled FFmpeg reads the RTSP stream) and no `pymavlink`. The
bridge's write-up is kept as `docs/IDRONAM_NOTES.md`.

- New **Drone** tab next to **Phone**:
  - live video
  - telemetry: mode/armed, GPS, position, altitude, speed, attitude, battery
  - Start / Stop recording
  - a connection card: IP, port, video URL, recorded size, JPEG quality,
    video delay
- A drone take uses the phone's session layout: `frames/` +
  `frame_timestamps.json` + `gps_data.json` + `session_meta.json`, plus
  `drone_telemetry.json`. The session list, viewer and Reconstruct button
  work on it unchanged. **Stopping a drone take always queues its
  reconstruction immediately.**
- **Indoor / Outdoor** switch, for the drone only and fixed per take:
  - Outdoor records the drone's GPS (10 Hz, 3D fix only) and reconstructs
    with `--gps-mode global`.
  - Indoor records none and reconstructs vision-only.
  - "Reconstruct again" on a drone take uses the mode it was flown in, not
    the global GPS setting.
- `tools/mock_drone.py` is a fake MAVLink drone for testing without the
  aircraft. `tests/test_drone_link.py` runs the codec checks and a full
  connect -> record -> finalize against it over a real socket.
- `data/studio_settings.json` is now gitignored, since it holds the drone's IP.

### Added `vggt_live.py`: VGGT reconstruction that starts while the flight is still streaming
Previously the only way to get a VGGT reconstruction was `vggt_reconstruct.py`,
which needs the complete recording (or video file) on disk before it starts -
even against a live phone stream, that meant waiting for capture to finish,
then waiting again for the whole thing to process. `vggt_live.py` is a new
entry point that processes each window the moment enough new frames have
arrived over the socket, instead of waiting for the recording to end first.

This is not a new reconstruction algorithm: `vggt_reconstruct.py`'s per-window
body (VGGT forward pass, robust-Sim3 seam alignment, voxel fusion) and its
tail (fuse, georeference, mesh, export, report) were extracted verbatim into
two shared functions, `_process_window` and `_finalize_and_write`, that both
entry points now call - so a live run and a `--from-recording` run of the
same footage produce the same geometry by construction, not by coincidence.
Verified three ways: re-running an already-reconstructed session through the
refactored batch path reproduced its `CHECKPOINT_REPORT.md` numbers (seam
scales, georeferencing residual) to within normal GPU run-to-run
floating-point variance; replaying that same session's frames over a real
TCP socket into `vggt_live.py` did the same; and a real 101s outdoor phone
session streamed straight into a finished, georeferenced reconstruction
(579 frames, 11 windows) 141.1s after connecting.

What it does not do: make VGGT faster. Measured throughput on a 16GB RTX
5070 Ti is ~5-8 frames/s against a 24-30fps phone stream - slower than real
time - so a live run's processing backlog still grows for as long as
capture continues. The saving is structural: batch wall time is
`capture_time + vggt_time` (processing cannot start until capture ends);
live wall time is `max(capture_time, vggt_time)` plus one window's tail,
because the two now overlap. Real whenever `vggt_time` is the larger stage
(usually true), bounded by the shorter one - not a "processing is now 20%
faster" claim, which the underlying GPU compute cost does not support. The
same real run also quantified a cost not obvious on paper: window
processing blocks the receiver for ~8-15s at a time, during which the
app's bounded video queue drops most newly-captured frames (backpressure,
by design) - that session delivered only ~5.7 fps versus the ~25 fps a
RECORD LOCALLY session on the same phone gets. A real tradeoff, not a bug;
documented in both READMEs so it's a choice, not a surprise.

### Fixed `vggt_live.py` exiting on the app's own reachability check
The Android app polls Settings -> Server IP every few seconds with a bare
connect-then-immediately-disconnect probe (`ReceiverProbe`, used to decide
whether to offer STREAM or only RECORD LOCALLY). `mock_receiver.py` loops
forever accepting connections, so it shrugs this off; `vggt_live.py`'s
`SocketPacketSource` accepts exactly one connection then stops listening -
so the very first probe after the process started was consuming that one
connection, and `rtvio.stream.source.StreamSession.run()` additionally
raises `SystemExit` for a connection that carried zero frames and zero IMU
samples (correct for `live_pipeline.py`, where that means a real flight
attempt got nothing; wrong here, where it usually just means a probe) -
between the two, the process exited before START STREAMING was ever tapped
for real. `main()` now loops, treating both a `SystemExit` and a
sub-2-frame connection as "that was a probe, keep listening" and only
proceeding to the one real reconstruction once actual data arrives.
Reproduced and verified fixed by sending two bare connect-and-close probes
at a running receiver, confirming it kept listening, then replaying a real
session's frames and confirming it still reconstructed correctly.

### `--from-recording` now auto-detects georeferencing from the session's own GPS data
`reconstruct_from_recording()` previously required an explicit
`--gps-mode global` to georeference a recorded session, even when the
session's `gps_data.json` already had real fixes in it - unlike `reconstruct()`
(the `--video` path), which has auto-defaulted `gps_mode` to `"global"`
whenever a `--gps` track is given since before this pipeline had a
`--from-recording` mode at all. Whether a session has GPS at all is already
a phone-side decision (Settings -> Outdoor mode on the Android app), so
requiring a second, easy-to-forget desktop flag to act on data the phone
already decided to record was redundant, not a safeguard. Fixed to mirror
`reconstruct()`'s existing default: a non-empty GPS track now enables
`gps_mode="global"` automatically; `--gps-mode off` still overrides it
explicitly for anyone who wants the geometry without georeferencing.

### Removed the EKF/IMU-dead-reckoning trajectory
`inertial_nav_ekf.py` (15-state ESKF: position/velocity/attitude/accel-bias/
gyro-bias, GPS fusion, ZUPT, Mahalanobis-gated vision-pose fusion) and
`trajectory_only.py` (the tool that isolated it for validation) are deleted,
along with their tests (`test_ekf.py`, `test_trajectory_only.py`) and the
`rtvio-trajectory` console script.

Root cause, not a filter bug: every real capture in this repo so far -
`output_flight1`, `output_my_flight`, every `output_indoor_test*` -
measured **zero GPS fixes fused**, the whole session, in every one of them.
With no GPS reaching it, the EKF had no absolute correction of any kind and
ran on pure IMU dead-reckoning, which drifts by construction (uncorrected
accel bias double-integrates into position error growing in a fixed
direction; uncorrected gyro bias curves the heading) - a physically
guaranteed failure mode, not evidence the filter itself was wrong. The EKF's
own test suite (10 checks in the now-removed `test_ekf.py`) passed
throughout.

Replaced with: the camera pose is now `tracking.py`'s `solvePnPRansac`
result directly, every frame it has enough inlier map points (previously
computed and reported but deliberately NOT fed back outside `--indoor` -
see the removed "Vision is deliberately not fused into the filter" section
of README.md, whose own measurements showed fusing it made the EKF's ATE
13-18x worse, because the map PnP resolves against was itself triangulated
from the filter's own earlier poses, so it was never independent
information). Each GPS fix now re-anchors the pose directly (a snap, not a
Kalman blend) instead of correcting a filter, gated by a new
`MAX_GPS_REANCHOR_SIGMA_M` (15 m) threshold on the fix's own accuracy - a
substitute for the down-weighting a Kalman update would have done
automatically. New `gyro_integrator.py`'s `GyroIntegrator` is the one IMU
signal kept: raw, stateless (no bias/covariance) gyro integration between
frames, feeding only `tracking.py`'s windowed-bundle-adjustment relative-
attitude prior - `BA_REL_PRIOR_ANG_RAD`, already documented as the fix for
dense stereo's dominant error source (`Z^2 * dtheta / baseline`). `so3.py`
holds the SO(3) math (`skew`/`axang_to_R`/`R_to_axang`, previously living on
the EKF class) plus a new `level_and_align_attitude` - the EKF's one-shot
gravity-leveling + GPS-course-yaw initialization, extracted as a plain
function since it was never actually a filter operation.

This is a genuine architecture change, not a relabeling: monocular vision
alone has no metric scale, so with GPS sparse or absent there is now nothing
bounding scale/position drift except vision's own internal geometric
consistency (BA's soft priors, `tracking.py`'s `_relative_reinit`) - honest
monocular VO, not VIO. A real tightly-coupled VIO (IMU preintegration
factors + joint sliding-window optimization over pose and landmarks
together, the way MSCKF/VINS-Mono/OKVIS do it) would close that gap, but is
a substantially larger rewrite than this change and remains future work; see
README.md's "Pose comes from vision, not IMU" for the full reasoning. New
`tests/test_pose_pipeline.py` (18 checks) covers what replaced the EKF:
`GyroIntegrator`'s rotation-delta math and stale-gap handling,
`level_and_align_attitude`'s leveling/yaw-alignment correctness, and
`LiveReconstructor`'s GPS-driven init, direct re-anchor, and accuracy-gate
rejection - driven directly against `on_imu`/`on_gps` rather than through a
real socket (`test_stream.py` already covers that plumbing). One of those
tests initially asserted the wrong `gps_seen` count and failed on first run
(the buffered-fixes replay at init also increments it, which the test had
not accounted for) - fixed in the test, not the code, once the actual
counter behavior was confirmed correct by inspection.

### Fixed: `_relative_reinit` gated on processed-frame count, not real time
A congested stretch (frame gaps, late-dropped events - present in every
session so far) can make N processed frames span far more real time than
`REINIT_STRIDE` assumed, long enough that the EKF position delta used for
scale is no longer trustworthy. Measured consequence on a real session:
reconstruction was fine (bounded, ~5m) through t=34s, then diverged to
361m by t=54s - consistent with a bad-scale reinit during a congested
stretch feeding a wrong measurement into a later vision-pose correction.
Replaced `REINIT_STRIDE` (frame count) with `REINIT_MIN_WINDOW_S`/
`REINIT_MAX_WINDOW_S` (real elapsed time, off the wire, not wall-clock
processing time) - a window that took too long is discarded (snapshot
refreshed, nothing reconstructed) rather than trusted. `Tracker.process_frame`
gained a `t_s` parameter to make this possible; `_relative_reinit` returns 0
immediately if not provided rather than falling back to the frame-count
version that produced the measured failure. New regression test
(`test_relative_reinit_ignores_a_too_stale_window`) pins this down.

### Confirmed on real hardware: sparse map finally populates
First real indoor capture with the `_relative_reinit` fix
(`output_indoor_test8`): sparse map went from 0 (every session before this)
to 394 points / 46,151 re-observations, and vision-pose fusion fired 100
times (was 0 in every prior session - it had nothing to correct against
before). The staleness fix above addresses the divergence found by
inspecting that same session's exported trajectory afterward.

### Fixed: sparse map stuck at 0 points on every indoor capture
`tracking.py`'s `Tracker` class has its OWN copy of the aerial-scale
baseline/depth gate (`MIN_BASELINE_M = 4.0`, `MIN/MAX_DEPTH_M = 5-250`),
separate from and upstream of `dense_stereo.py`'s (fixed for `--indoor`
earlier in this changelog) - a track has to pass Tracker's gate before it
can ever reach dense stereo's. This was missed in that earlier fix.
Confirmed via new per-frame diagnostics (`active`/`new`/`reobs` counts,
added below) on a real indoor capture: active tracks stayed healthy
(500-1200 the whole session) while the sparse map stayed at exactly 0,
because no indoor track ever accumulates 4 metres of baseline before
losing view of the feature - it's essentially impossible in a room.
Cross-checked against `../rtvio/LiveVisualInertialMapper.m` (the original
MATLAB implementation `tracking.py` replaced): its `MIN_BASELINE = 0.02`
(2 cm, tuned for a tabletop mug) and `MAX_REPROJ_DEPTH = 20` with no
minimum depth at all confirm this is a real, scale-dependent parameter,
not a hardcoded law - `tracking.py`'s own docstring explains it raised
this specifically to fix aerial-UAV triangulation (two consecutive frames
at flight speed are only ~0.33 m apart), and nobody revisited it for
indoor use afterward. `live_pipeline._lock_intrinsics` now sets
`tracker.MIN_BASELINE_M`/`MIN_DEPTH_M`/`MAX_DEPTH_M` from the same
resolved values `_resolve_stereo_geometry` already computes for
`dense_stereo.py`, so both gates can't disagree again.

### Added per-frame tracker diagnostics
`tracking.py`'s `process_frame` already computed `active_tracks`,
`num_new_points`, and `num_reobserved` every frame; they were computed and
discarded. Now surfaced in the live progress line and `REPORT.md`'s Model
section - this is what made the bug above provable instead of another
guess: `active` heathy + `new`/`map` stuck at 0 pinpoints a promotion-gate
problem specifically, as opposed to a feature-detection or track-survival
problem, which would look different in these same three numbers.

### `--indoor` now uses room-scale stereo geometry
`dense_stereo.py`'s `MIN/MAX_STEREO_BASELINE_M` (4-20 m) and
`MIN/MAX_DEPTH_M` (5-250 m) are tuned for an 80 m-altitude aerial survey.
Applied to handheld indoor capture at 1-3 m range: almost no frame pair
ever reached the 4 m minimum baseline while still overlapping in view
(explaining the persistently tiny keyframe counts across every indoor
session so far), and the depth-range fallback used whenever the sparse map
is too thin searched 5-250 m for a scene actually a few metres away -
plausibly the source of the wedge/fan-shaped point clusters seen in every
indoor capture. `--indoor` now sets these to 0.3-2.5 m baseline and 0.3-8 m
depth (room-scale engineering estimates, not measured); new
`--min/max-stereo-baseline-m` and `--min/max-depth-m` flags override
either individually regardless of `--indoor`. Implemented by having
`live_pipeline.main()` set `dense_stereo`'s module-level constants at
startup (every function that reads them does so as a global at call time,
not a bound default argument, so this needed no changes inside
`dense_stereo.py` itself) - see `_resolve_stereo_geometry`.

### Added `--indoor` mode for GPS-less sessions
New `live_pipeline.py --indoor` flag: skips waiting `COURSE_TIMEOUT_S` for a
GPS-derived heading (starts almost immediately with unobserved yaw instead),
and switches `dense_stereo.py`/`tracking.py`'s baseline/depth gates to a
room-scale preset (see the entry below). At the time this landed, the pose
mechanism itself also differed by `--indoor` (whether `solvePnPRansac`'s
result got fused into the EKF); that distinction no longer exists - see
"Removed the EKF/IMU-dead-reckoning trajectory" above, vision now drives the
pose unconditionally. Not validated against ground truth (none is available
for indoor motion in this repo) - see README.md's "Known limitations" for
what `--indoor` still trades away (yaw stays arbitrary; output is not
georeferenced) and how to validate it (pace out a known path).

### Restructured to a standard `src/` package layout
- Moved all pipeline modules into `src/rtvio/` (installable via
  `pip install -e .`); `stream/` is now `src/rtvio/stream/`.
- Converted intra-package imports to relative imports (`from . import ...`).
- Moved `test_geometry.py` into `tests/`; both test files now import
  `rtvio` as a package instead of patching `sys.path`.
- Moved `camera_intrinsics.json`, `calib_frames/`, and `output_flight1/`
  under `data/` (`data/camera_intrinsics.json`, `data/calib_frames/`,
  `data/outputs/`). `live_pipeline.py`'s `--intrinsics`/`--out-root`
  defaults now point there.
- Consolidated `session1.md`…`session7.md` into `docs/dev_notes/`, and
  `STREAMING.md` / `CAMERA_INTRINSICS_INTEGRATION.md` / `INTRINSICS_SUMMARY.md`
  into `docs/`. Root now holds only `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Added `pyproject.toml` (setuptools `src` layout, `rtvio-live` console
  script) and a `.gitignore` covering `__pycache__/`, build artifacts, and
  `data/outputs/`.
- Removed `ingest.py`'s `Dataset`/`load_video_frames`/`load_json` — the
  batch loader they existed for was already removed; `sharpness_score` and
  `downsample_intrinsics` (the two the live path actually uses) are kept.
- Removed `tests/test_geometry.py`'s `test_gt_mesh_is_in_enu` - permanently
  dead since its fixture (`gt_scene_mesh.obj`) and its dependency
  (`evaluate.py`) were already removed in the prior cleanup pass.

### Earlier cleanup (see `docs/dev_notes/` for the sessions that produced it)
- Removed the synthetic Blender flight dataset, the batch `pipeline.py` and
  `evaluate.py` that consumed it, and the tools that only existed to drive
  or score it (`tools/replay_dataset_as_phone.py`, `tools/score_live_run.py`).
- Removed stale scratch files: old run outputs, debug screenshots, the
  first prototype demo, and hackathon slide decks.
