Near-real-time reconstruction from the live phone stream.

    python -m rtvio.live_pipeline --port 5555 --run-id live1
    # or, after `pip install -e .`:
    rtvio-live --port 5555 --run-id live1

THE RULE

The model is built from packets as they arrive. There is no file-reading
code path in this module: `LiveReconstructor` receives decoded packets
from `rtvio.stream.source.StreamSession` and never learns where they came from.
The recorder, if enabled, is a sibling subscriber writing a replayable
fixture; deleting it cannot change the model.

WHAT "NEAR REAL TIME" MEANS HERE, PRECISELY

Three lanes run at three different latencies, because triangulation needs
parallax and parallax needs the camera to have moved:

  ~1 ms     GyroIntegrator folds every IMU sample's gyro reading into a
            rotation delta. No pose change - see "POSE COMES FROM VISION,
            NOT IMU" below - this is purely bookkeeping for the BA prior.
  ~0.3 s    Sparse tracking (solvePnPRansac each frame is the live pose),
            then windowed bundle adjustment over BA_WINDOW frames. Live
            sparse map, refined trajectory.
  ~2-5 s    Dense stereo for keyframe i, fired as soon as frames far
            enough past i exist to give a 4-20 m baseline. Cloud tiles are
            appended to a growing model.

Nothing waits for the session to end. The final mesh/LAS/DSM write at
shutdown is serialisation of a model that was already built, not a second
reconstruction pass.

POSE COMES FROM VISION, NOT IMU

There is no IMU-integrated trajectory here (see CHANGELOG.md "Removed the
EKF/IMU-dead-reckoning trajectory" for the numbers that motivated this): the
live camera pose (self.pose_R/self.pose_p) is tracking.py's solvePnPRansac
result each frame, carried forward unchanged on a frame where PnP has too
few inlier map points, and snapped directly to each incoming GPS fix's ENU
position (no Kalman blending - a discontinuous re-anchor, not a smooth
correction). GyroIntegrator's only job is supplying tracking.py's bundle
adjustment with a gyro-only rotation delta between frames - it never
touches self.pose_R/self.pose_p. One direct consequence: with no GPS at
all, there is nothing to bound scale/position drift except vision's own
geometry (BA's soft priors, _relative_reinit's multi-view triangulation) -
this is honest monocular VO, not VIO.

MEMORY

Only the frames a pending keyframe still needs are held - from the oldest
unprocessed keyframe forward, bounded by SEARCH_AHEAD_FRAMES. That is
~100 frames, ~250 MB at 720x1280. The old batch loader held every frame of
the session, which is ~9 GB for a 60 s 1080p capture and OOMs before
anything else does; the streaming shape removes that failure entirely.

WHAT IS NOT VALIDATED

This module was first exercised end to end against a test double
(tools/replay_dataset_as_phone.py, since removed) that spoke the same wire
format over a real socket but was driven by a synthetic dataset - so
measured numbers from that phase validated the RECEIVER, not the handset.
There has since been at least one real capture from a physical phone (see
data/outputs/output_flight1/REPORT.md), but treat any number not backed by
a real-capture report with the same caution.
