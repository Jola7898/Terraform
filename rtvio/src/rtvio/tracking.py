"""
Sparse visual front end: replaces live_visual_inertial_mapper.py.

Why this is structured differently from the old mug-demo version:
the old code re-detected ORB features every frame and matched them only
against the IMMEDIATELY PREVIOUS frame, then required
baseline(prev_frame, curr_frame) >= MIN_BASELINE before triangulating.
At aerial scale that baseline check can never pass: a UAV moving 10 m/s at
30fps covers ~0.33m between consecutive frames, so two-consecutive-frame
baseline is always ~0.33m regardless of which pair you look at - nowhere
near enough parallax to triangulate a point 80m away. Triangulation would
have silently never fired.

This version keeps persistent point *tracks* across many frames using
Lucas-Kanade optical flow (cheap, robust to the small per-frame motion
that breaks independent ORB matching), and only triangulates a track once
its ACCUMULATED baseline (first-seen pose vs. current pose, not
consecutive-frame pose) clears MIN_BASELINE - typically ~15-20 frames in,
by which point there's enough real parallax.

Also drops the old code's fake "Gaussian splat" PLY fields (scale/rot/
opacity heuristics that were never optimized against any rendering loss -
see rtvio_3/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md 2.1) in favor of a plain colored point
cloud; dense_stereo.py is what actually produces the dense reconstruction
the PS asks for, this module's job is pose refinement.

# Camera-axis convention. Poses (R, p) everywhere in this repo are the

# the camera looks along -R[:,2] and its image "up" is +R[:,1]. OpenCV's
# projection convention instead looks along +Z with image "down" as +Y.
# The two differ by a 180-degree rotation about the camera's X axis:
#   X_cv = S @ R.T @ (X_world - p),   S = diag(1, -1, -1)
# S is its own inverse and has det +1, so it is a genuine rotation and can

# adjustment residual, and solvePnPRansac's output) must apply it - an
# earlier version applied it in none of them, which silently mirrored
# every projection about the principal point and left the PnP attitude
# measurement 180 degrees out, so the EKF's innovation gate rejected

        """Periodic two-view relative reconstruction, decoupled from the
        long-term-drifting absolute pose the incremental path above
        depends on (see MIN_BASELINE_M's class-level comment for the
        measured 24m/49s failure this addresses).

        Every REINIT_MIN_WINDOW_S to REINIT_MAX_WINDOW_S of REAL elapsed
        time (t_s, off the wire - not wall-clock processing time), matches
        the current active tracks (by persistent track_id, not array
        position - positions shift as tracks are lost) against a snapshot
        taken at the window's start, recovers relative pose PURELY from
        that 2D correspondence (Essential matrix - unaffected by how much
        the caller's own pose estimate has drifted since), and scales it
        using only the MAGNITUDE of that pose's change over this short
        window - short enough that drift hasn't had time to dominate it,
        and using only the magnitude (not the vector) sidesteps a wrong yaw
        entirely, since that only rotates the direction, not the speed.

        Gated on REAL TIME, not processed-frame count, because this
        project's whole machine runs under real congestion (frame gaps,
        late-dropped events, sub-real-time throughput, every session so
        far) - a frame-count stride is blind to that: during a congested
        stretch, N processed frames can span far more real time than
        intended, long enough that the position delta this method relies
        on for scale is no longer trustworthy. Measured consequence of the
        frame-count version on a real session (under the old EKF-driven
        pose): reconstruction was fine (bounded, ~5m) through t=34s, then
        diverged to 361m by t=54s - consistent with a bad-scale reinit
        during a congested stretch poisoning a later PnP-based vision
        correction. If t_s is not provided, this is disabled outright
        (returns 0) rather than falling back to the frame-count version
        that produced that failure.

        Honest limitation: each reinit window is anchored to the caller's
        OWN pose estimate at snapshot time (vision, snapped to GPS on each
        fix - see live_pipeline.py), so consecutive windows can still drift
        relative to EACH OTHER over the session - this fixes local
        geometric consistency (a window's own points are correctly shaped
        and scaled), not global consistency across the whole session, which
        needs GPS or loop closure to ever be exact.

        pose. This is the pure numpy/scipy stand-in for what a GTSAM factor
        graph would do (GTSAM has no Windows wheel on this machine).

        GAUGE. Reprojection error alone does not determine where a window
        sits in the world: rigidly transforming every camera and every point
        together leaves every residual unchanged, so a pure-reprojection
        solve has 7 unconstrained directions (6 rigid + scale) and
        least_squares will happily wander along them - observed in an early
        version as the estimate blowing up past 1e40 metres.

        An earlier fix held pose 0 of the window FIXED. That removes the
        gauge freedom, but at a price: it discards what the IMU/GPS filter
        knows about all the OTHER poses, and it makes the whole window
        inherit pose 0's error exactly. Measured, feeding those results back
        to the filter made the trajectory an order of magnitude worse
        (ATE 2.2 m -> 24.9 m).

        This version instead adds an explicit PRIOR RESIDUAL for every pose
        in the window - position and attitude, weighted by solvePnPRansac's
        own typical accuracy (BA_POSE_PRIOR_POS_M/ANG_RAD; see their
        comment). That pins the gauge (with several non-collinear camera
        positions anchored, no rigid transform or rescaling leaves the priors
        unchanged) while still letting every pose move as far as the images
        justify. It is also simply the correct estimator: the priors carry
        the incoming pose's own information (vision, occasionally re-anchored
        to GPS), the reprojections carry the visual information from THIS
        window's images, and this is their joint MAP solution rather than an
        arbitrary choice between the two.
