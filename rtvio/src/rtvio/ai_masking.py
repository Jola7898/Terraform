    Two model/class-list presets (session 2+3 finding - see
    docs/dev_notes/HANDOFF_SESSION2.md/3.md): stock COCO-trained yolov8n-seg (this class's
    default, unchanged) detects essentially NOTHING on nadir (straight-down)
    drone footage - confirmed on a real frame with 3 visible parked cars, 0
    detections at any confidence/resolution tested. A car viewed from
    directly overhead looks nothing like COCO's side/oblique training
    images. For nadir footage, use `DynamicMasker.for_nadir_aerial()`
    instead, which loads a YOLOv8 checkpoint fine-tuned on VisDrone (aerial
    imagery, vehicle/pedestrian classes seen from above) - confirmed on the
    same test frame to actually detect the cars (0.86/0.83/0.79 confidence
    at imgsz=1280, vs. 0 for stock COCO at any setting).
