"""
Unit tests for the phone-session -> VGGT batch bridge added in
vggt_reconstruct.py (reconstruct_from_recording / _load_recording_frames /
load_gps_track_from_recording), and for the recorder robustness fix in
stream/recorder.py's on_session_end.

Deliberately covers only the frame/GPS-loading logic, not a real VGGT
forward pass: that needs a GPU + the 5GB checkpoint and takes 1-2+ minutes,
which doesn't belong in a routine test run. The real end-to-end proof (a
genuine VGGT reconstruction from a phone-shaped session fixture, correctly
skipping a dropped frame and consuming its GPS directly) was run manually
and is documented in docs/dev_notes/HANDOFF_SESSION3.md; this file guards the fast, always-
exercisable part of that path against regressions.
